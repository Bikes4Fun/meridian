# Minimal Code Changes

Keep any changes and additions to an absolute bare minimum for the requested functionality. Emphasize short and simple.

## Rules

1. **Bare minimum**: Implement only what was asked—no extra features, helpers, or "improvements"
2. **Short and simple**: Prefer fewer lines, less branching, simpler logic
3. **No scope creep**: Do not refactor, expand, or polish unrelated code
4. **One thing at a time**: Address the specific request only
