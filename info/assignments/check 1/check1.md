# Progress Checkpoint 1 Agenda

## 1. Status Check
- **Semester Week 3?** — ahead of schedule but it may not have been an agressive enough approach (~2 weeks)
- Completed: Weeks 1-5 of plan (research, design, core setup, clock MVP)
- Started: Weeks 6-8 (medication, emergency, contacts services)
- Recently fixed: calendar display bugs, removed responsive_system.py

## 2. Questions for Instructor
- **Calendar data entry**: Should I integrate a calendar API (Google Calendar, iCal) so caregivers can add events from their phones, or is manual database entry acceptable for MVP?
- **What matters most?** What core functionality is most important next?

## 3. Attachments
