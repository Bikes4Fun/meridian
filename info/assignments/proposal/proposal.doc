Dementia Patient and Family Digital Assistant

Deanna Garrett, Senior Project Proposal, Fall 2026

Basic Overview
A digital assistant specifically designed to decrease stress and daily burdens for dementia patients and their families by providing daily orientation, easy family tracking and communication, and emergency management assistance via a large-display touch screen with accessible design.

1. Problem Overview

Target Audience
The primary target audience consists of individuals living with dementia and their family caregivers. Specifically:
• Primary Users: Adults aged 65+ with mild to moderate dementia who live independently or with minimal supervision
• Secondary Users: Family caregivers, adult children, emergency services if called to the patients home
• Future Users: Outpatient healthcare providers, inpatient facilities caring for advanced dementia patients
• Demographics: Approximately 6.7 million Americans aged 65+ live with dementia, projections reach 12.7 million by 2050 (Alzheimer's Association, 2024). Of these, a majority (approximately 4.2) million live independently at home with family or minimal supervision

Context and Current State
Dementia patients face significant daily challenges that impact their independence and safety:
• Time Disorientation: Difficulty tracking dates, times, and appointments, confusion may increase throughout the day
• Medication Management: Complex medication schedules with high risk of missed doses or overdosing
• Emergency Preparedness: Difficulty communicating critical medical information during emergencies, forgetting diagnosis and even hiding/misleading providers
• Family Connection: Paranoia and hypervigilance about family member safety, believing loved ones are "lost" since they don't remember recent visits contributing to wandering behavior
• Safety Concerns: Increased risk of falls, wandering, and inability to access emergency services

Significance
The consequences of unaddressed dementia care challenges are severe:
• Safety Risks: Medication errors account for 125,000 deaths annually in the US (CDC, 2023)
• Emergency Delays: emergency response time increases 40% if patients can't give clear info (NIH, 2023)
• Burnout: 40% of family report high stress, leading to patient institutionalization (Alzheimer's Assoc., 2024)
• Costs: Dementia costs $345 billion annually, with 70% borne by families (Alzheimer's Assoc., 2024)

Existing Solutions and Their Shortcomings
Current solutions are fragmented and inadequate:
• Targeted Digital Clocks: Large fonts but difficult to program due to minimalistic interface
• Medication Reminders: Phone apps that may be physically challenging due to screen size and require patient to remember if they took medication
• Family Communication: Small screens with confusing interfaces
• Emergency Systems: Expensive subscription services ($30-150/month) that don't aid in daily communication (future feature)
• Fall Detection: iOS gyroscopic falls risk system but no integration with holistic, single system actual detection and emergency systems such as necklaces etc listed above. (far future feature)

Gap Analysis: No integrated solution provides comprehensive daily support, emergency preparedness, and family connectivity in a dementia-friendly interface.

TV-Based Interface Rationale: A TV-Screen sized, touch screen system is a familiar technology, avoids physical challenges of small screens, a large view reduces cognitive load.

2. Proposed Solution

Core Concept
A comprehensive TV-based digital assistant specifically designed for dementia patients that provides:
• Daily Orientation: Large, clear displays of time, date, and appointments
• Emergency Preparedness: Instant access to critical medical information and emergency contacts
• Family Connection: Simple photo-based family directory with contact information and safety status

Additional Features
• Safety Monitoring: Integration with fall detection and emergency response systems
• Medication Management: Visual medication reminders with safety features

The system is designed following dementia accessibility principles: consistent visual layouts, clear feedback, high contrast colors, large text, and limited decision branches to minimize cognitive load and maximize usability.

Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Features

Dementia Clock System
• Large Font Display: Day of week, date, part of day (morning, midday, evening, night), month, year in high-contrast, easy-to-read font
• Appointment Management: 
  - Clear display of upcoming appointments
  - Clearly display "No Appointments today" indicator when no appointments scheduled (anxiety and obsession about forgetting things is a common challenge for dementia patients)
  - Appointment details: who will drive, when they will arrive for pickup, confirmation status, if related tasks have been completed (pre appointment labs etc)

Basic Medication Management
• Visual Medication Schedule: AM, Noon, PM, Bedtime medication reminders with accessible color and texture coded indicators, food requirements etc
• Safety Features: PRN medication tracking, overdose prevention alerts, emergency contact notifications, photo of medication, explanation of its purpose, compliance tracking/loved one notifications
• Major Integration: QR codes on preexisting medication packets system for verification before dispensing

Emergency Information System
• Quick Access Medical ID: Name, DOB, photo, emergency contacts, diagnosis, medications, doctor 
• Legal Documents: DNR status, medical proxy, power of attorney information
• Major Addition: Emergency Services: One-touch 911 calling with landline integration

Family Connection
• Photo Directory: Family member photos with relationship labels
• Contact Information: Phone numbers and addresses
• Living Arrangements: Who lives with the patient, family member locations/safety status
• Simple Communication: Easy-touch calling to family members

Family Management System / Mobile App access
• Primary Caregiver Control: Main family decision-maker has full system access
• Permission Levels: Primary caregiver (full control), Family members (location sharing, visit scheduling), Extended family (view-only access)
• Location Sharing: Family members can share their location and safety status
• Visit Scheduling: Family members can schedule and confirm visits through the app
• Emergency: Automatic alerts to family during emergencies, remote screen view override to ICE screen

Post-MVP Roadmap
Phase 2 Features (Weeks 8-12): FaceTime Integration, Location Services
Phase 3 + (Possible) Features (Weeks 13-15+): QR Code Medication Reader, Family Education Portal, Legal Resources, Professional Contacts, Print Functionality, Advanced Safety Features

Connecting Solution to Problem
• Time Disorientation → Large, clear date/time display with appointment integration
• Medication Errors → Visual reminders with safety alerts and overdose prevention
• Emergency Delays → Instant access to medical information and emergency contacts
• Family Isolation → Simple photo-based family directory with one-touch communication
• Caregiver Stress → Comprehensive information system reducing caregiver burden

3. Validation Plan

User Testing & Research

• Week 6: Usability testing with 3+ dementia patients using paper prototypes
• Week 10: Beta testing with 2-3 families using functional prototype
• Week 14: Final user acceptance testing with complete system

Ethics: User testing involving dementia patients with only mild or moderate diagnosis, conducted with time limits, patient and caregiver consent and caregiver observation. Medication tracking integration would need to be reviewed by experts such as pharmacists, Doctors/AP PCP's, and other tech/medical ethics and safety experts.

Feedback Integration
• weekly sessions with users for usability testing, and satisfaction surveys as tasks/features are completed

Software Testing
• Automated Testing: Unit tests for core functionality, integration tests for system components
• Manual QA: Daily testing of user interface, medication reminders, and emergency features
• Accessibility Testing: Regular testing with dementia simulation tools and accessibility checkers
• Safety Testing: Comprehensive testing of emergency features and medication safety systems

Metrics: measured through task completion rates, usability, and caregiver satisfaction (target: >4.0/5.0 rating).
